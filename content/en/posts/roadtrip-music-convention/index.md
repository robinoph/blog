**Content warning:** slightly exaggerated drama and other bs. You should not take this too seriously.

Listen here and listen carefully for these sacred commandments may one day save your life. For our love of music can unite us, it is also a source of great division. And death. 

In the midst of our lengthy roadtrip, I left the safe comfort of my seat and earbuds to meet with my musical allies and adversaries at the treacherous Burger King found at some sketchy motorway services in England. Our goal? Establish humane rules of engagement that would allow us to enjoy the wonderous landscapes of Scotland while listening to some sick beats.

These core principles are as follows:

1. There shall be no limit on the selected musical genres. Freedom of variety is absolute.
2. A belligerent may request for the current song to be skipped. A majority vote is required to ratify this treaty.
3. A song that is being played for the first time during a trip is exempt from rule #2. It never ought to be skipped.
4. The parties can agree beforehand that a certain song, or songs from a particular artist, may never be skipped under any circumstances. Avicci is an excellent example. The vote, however, must be unanimous.

These pillars of peace can be further amended according to the needs of the involved powers. Some of our ratified resolutions include:

- Rule #1 appendix: playing 4 Dutch Schlager, rapping and/or Hardstyle (with the exception of the euphoric subgenre) songs within 1 hour is strictly forbidden. The international tribunal in The Hague is authorised to prosecute perpetrators.

- Rule #2 appendix: an informal agreement between the parties can be enacted to skip a song halfway through its duration if a majority vote cannot be found.

These edicts have been verified and tested by yours truly during my 2-week trip while I traversed the beatiful North Coast 500 road alongside 2 good friends. Heed these words and you may yet live to listen another day.
