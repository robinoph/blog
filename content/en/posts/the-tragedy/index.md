Did you ever hear the tragedy of the Community Enterprise OS? I thought not. It’s not a story IBM would tell you. It’s a FOSS legend. CentOS was a free, community maintained rebuild of RHEL, so powerful and so stable, it could even be used... in production.

It was such a well supported project, that one could even keep using the same OS with 10 years of updates. The open source community is pathway to many successes most proprietary companies consider to be... unnatural.

The project became so popular, the only thing everyone was afraid of was it being acquired by a multinational company, which eventually, of course, it did. Unfortunately, CentOS was embraced and extended by Red Hat, then Red Hat extinguished the project at its peak. Ironic. It once could free others from rolling releases, but not itself.
